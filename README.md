Zettacast is a simple, fast and lightweight PHP dependency injection framework.

## Motivation
Zettacast is made for those who want to have a powerful and straightforward tool for dependency injection within their projects
without the - sometimes massive - overhead caused by other commonly used frameworks, opening the possibility of
integrating DI into already existing and complex projects.

The API implemented by Zettacast tries to be very similar to that of [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice/tree/master),
a dependency injection for Java developed by Google.

## Install
Once the project is released, the recommended way to install Zettacast will be via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```json
{
    "require": {
        "rodriados/zettacast": "^1.0"
    }
}
```
